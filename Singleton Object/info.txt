The static variable of your class are not garbage collected until the app domain hosting your class is unloaded. The Dispose() method will not be called, because it is an instance method, and you said that you wouldn't create any instances of your class.

If you would like to make use of the Dispose() method, make your object a singleton, create one instance of it, and dispose of it explicitly when your application is about to exit.

public class MyClass : IDisposable {
    public IList List1<int> {get; private set;}
    public IDictionary<string,string> Dict1 {get; private set;}
    public void Dispose() {
        // Do something here
    }
    public static MyClass Instance {get; private set;}
    static MyClass() {
        Instance = new MyClass();
    }
    public static void DisposeInstance() {
        if (instance != null) {
            Instance.Dispose();
            Instance = null;
        }
    }
}
